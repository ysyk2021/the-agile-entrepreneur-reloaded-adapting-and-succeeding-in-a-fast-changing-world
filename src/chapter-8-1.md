2. To improve decision-making: Measuring success provides entrepreneurs with valuable data and insights that can help them make more informed decisions. This enables them to pivot their business model or strategies as needed to achieve greater success.

3. To motivate and engage employees: Measuring success can also motivate and engage employees by providing them with a clear understanding of the company's goals and objectives. This encourages them to work towards achieving these goals and fosters a sense of ownership and accountability within the organization.
