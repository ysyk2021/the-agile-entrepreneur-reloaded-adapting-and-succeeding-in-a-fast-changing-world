Entrepreneurial agility is essential for adapting to change and continuously improving your strategies. In this chapter, we will explore techniques for assessing your current level of entrepreneurial agility.

Evaluate Your Company's Ability to Pivot

Pivoting is the ability to change direction quickly in response to new information or changing circumstances. To assess your company's ability to pivot, consider the following questions:

1. How quickly can your company make changes to its strategy or product offerings?
2. How willing are you and your team to make changes when necessary?
3. What processes do you have in place to gather feedback and evaluate the effectiveness of your strategies?

Analyze Your Company's Culture
------------------------------

Company culture plays a significant role in entrepreneurial agility. A culture that values collaboration, innovation, and continuous improvement is more likely to be agile. To analyze your company's culture, consider the following questions:

1. How does your company approach decision-making?
2. Does your company encourage risk-taking and experimentation?
3. How open is communication within your company?

Assess Your Company's Flexibility
---------------------------------

Flexibility is the ability to adapt to changing circumstances. To assess your company's flexibility, consider the following questions:

1. How well does your company respond to unexpected challenges or opportunities?
2. How quickly can your company adjust its operations or strategies?
3. What systems do you have in place to manage risk and uncertainty?

Solicit Feedback from Customers and Employees
---------------------------------------------

Soliciting feedback from customers and employees can provide valuable insights into your company's entrepreneurial agility. To solicit feedback, consider the following:

1. Conduct customer surveys or focus groups to gather feedback on your products or services.
2. Hold regular employee engagement surveys or one-on-one meetings to gather feedback on your company's culture and processes.
3. Use feedback to identify areas for improvement and develop strategies to address them.
